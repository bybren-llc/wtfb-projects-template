## Usage

```
/writers-room
```

## What It Does

1. **Gathers Context:** Collects premise, existing material, constraints, and creative goals
2. **Convenes Agents:** Runs 6 specialized agents in parallel:
   - **Story Architect** - Structure and form
   - **Story Analyst** - Character and meaning
   - **Dialogue Writer** - Voice and tone
   - **Scene Writer** - Visual setpieces
   - **Standards Reviewer** - Quality and originality
   - **Research Specialist** - Authenticity
3. **Synthesizes Direction:** Combines best ideas into unified creative direction
4. **Outputs Document:** Creates `creative-direction.md` to guide production

## When to Use

- Starting a new screenplay
- Beginning a major rewrite or reimagining
- When creative direction is uncertain
- When you want expert perspectives before committing to an approach

## Required Input

- **Premise/Logline:** What's the story about?
- **Existing Material:** Any previous versions, source material, notes
- **Target Tone:** Comedy, drama, thriller, etc. + rating level
- **Constraints:** Runtime, budget tier, sacred elements
- **Freedom Level:** What can change vs. what's fixed

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask user for:
- Story premise or logline
- Any existing material or versions
- Target tone and audience
- Constraints and must-haves
- What's open for reimagining

### Step 2: Convene the Writers Room

Each agent provides their perspective:

**Story Architect** speaks to:
- Structure approach (traditional, experimental, hybrid)
- Act breakdown and key beats
- Pacing recommendations
- Genre conventions to embrace or subvert

**Story Analyst** speaks to:
- Thematic depth and meaning
- Character arcs and relationships
- Emotional journey of the audience
- What the story is really about

**Dialogue Writer** speaks to:
- Voice and tone of dialogue
- Character differentiation through speech
- Subtext opportunities
- Memorable line potential

**Scene Writer** speaks to:
- Most cinematic moments
- Visual storytelling opportunities
- Opening and closing images
- Must-have setpieces

**Standards Reviewer** speaks to:
- Market viability
- Originality assessment
- Potential comparison titles
- Quality benchmarks

**Research Specialist** speaks to:
- Authenticity requirements
- Research needed
- Technical accuracy
- Cultural sensitivity

### Step 3: Synthesize Vision

Combine perspectives into unified direction:
- Consensus points
- Creative tensions to resolve
- Clear direction forward
- "North Star" guiding principle

### Step 4: Output Creative Direction

Create `creative-direction.md` containing:
- Individual agent pitches
- Synthesized unified vision
- Must-have scenes list
- Tone and voice guidelines
- Explicit "off-limits" list
- Single "North Star" guiding principle
